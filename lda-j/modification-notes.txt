Code in the knowceans package was extended and modified by David Dunkley (david.dunkley@sri.com).

@date 20091012

None of modifications have changed the LDA logic.

 1) Created CokusFactory and the ICokus interface to allow the all-Java version of cokus to be loaded if the
DLL version is not available. LdaEstimate has been modified to call the factory, rather than being hard-coded
to load the DLL. The CokusFactory uses log4j to log an informational message if the DLL cannot be found. This
is the only 3rd party dependency that was added and can be commented-out or removed as desired.

2) Allow the code to be reentrant; converted updatable global statics to locals, etc.

3) A couple of minor bug fixes and performance enhancements.

4) Make LdaEstimate useable without requiring or creating disk files.

5) Commented-out System print statements from non-test code.

6) Allow client access to 'beta' results without requiring or creating disk files.

7) Allow multiple LDA engines to be run concurrently within the same VM.
